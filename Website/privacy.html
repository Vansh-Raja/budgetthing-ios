  <main class="wrap">
    <p>BudgetThing is designed to be privacy-first. You can use the app as a guest (local-only) or sign in to sync your
      data across devices.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>Guest Mode:</strong> If you do not sign in, all data is stored locally on your device. We do not have
      access to it.</p>
    <p><strong>Signed In:</strong> If you choose to sign in, your data (transactions, accounts, categories) is encrypted
      and stored on our secure cloud servers (powered by Convex) to enable synchronization across your devices.</p>

    <h2>Shared Data</h2>
    <p><strong>Shared Trips:</strong> When you join or create a Shared Trip, your name, profile picture, and any transactions
      you add to that specific trip are visible to other participants of that trip. You can leave a shared trip at any time.</p>

    <h2>Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data. You can delete your account and all associated cloud data at any time
      directly from the app Settings page.</p>

    <h2>Analytics & Tracking</h2>
    <p>BudgetThing does not include third-party advertising or tracking SDKs that sell your data.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this policy, please contact us at <a
