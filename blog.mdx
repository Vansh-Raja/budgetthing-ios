# BudgetThing

I'm pretty organized in most areas of my life, but tracking money has never been one of them. I've tried a lot of budget apps. Some were too complicated, some were paid, some were free but full of ads. None of them stuck.

So I built my own.

## The Problem

Every app I tried made adding an expense take too long. Open the app, tap "Add Expense," get taken to a new screen, enter the amount, swipe to another screen to pick a category, maybe add a note on yet another screen, then finally hit save. By the time you're done, you've forgotten why you opened the app in the first place.

I just wanted to type a number, pick a category, and move on.

## What I Built

BudgetThing is a simple expense tracker for iPhone. The main screen is a calculator. You open the app, type the amount (you can even do quick math right there), pick a category, and hit the checkmark. Done. One screen.

If you want to add a note or pick a specific account, those options are right there — but they're not required. The app doesn't force you through multiple steps just to log a coffee. The most common action should be the fastest one.

Categories use emoji so you can spot them at a glance. No reading through a list of text labels.

Transactions are grouped by month and easy to scroll through. You can filter if you need to.

The whole app is offline. No accounts, no sign-ups, no servers. Your data stays on your phone. I might add iCloud sync later, but for now it's simple and private.

## Who It's For

Anyone who's given up on budgeting because every app made it feel like work. If you just want to track what you spend without learning a new system, this is for you.

## What's Next

This was my first Swift app. I'd built an Expo app before, but this was my first time working with Swift and SwiftUI. I started simple — offline only, core features.

Now I'm working on a few additions. iCloud sync is on the list. And eventually I want to add something like Splitwise, where you can track shared expenses with friends and settle up.

## Current Status

BudgetThing is in TestFlight right now. I worked on it heavily a few months ago, took a break, and I'm picking it back up now.

Built because I got tired of apps that made simple things complicated.
